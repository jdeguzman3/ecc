			<h2>Hours</h2>
			<p class="introduction">

Read descriptions below to find out more information about them. Please note that unless otherwise noted, club events are open to everyone and participants of all ages are welcome.

			<div class="hours-monday">
				<h3>Monday Night</h3>
				<p class="registration-time"><span class="bold">Registration time:</span> 6:30pm</p>
				<p class="start-time"><span class="bold">Start time:</span> 7:00pm</p>
				<p class="format">
					<span class="bold">Format:</span> 4 games with active time controls (25 minutes plus 10 seconds delay).  
				</p>
				<p class="entry-fee">
					<span class="bold">Entry fee:</span> Free, but a club membership is required which costs $30 a year. Alternatively, $3 nightly dues can be paid. First visit is free.
				</p>
				<p class="atmosphere">
					<span class="bold">Atmosphere:</span> Friendly and casual. Noise levels are not very strict and the atmosphere is casual, as games are not rated.
				</p>
				<p class="players">
					<span class="bold">Type of players:</span> The majority of players are either beginner or intermediate, although once in a while Expert level players come as well. If you have not played tournament chess before, this is an ideal place to start.
				</p>

			<div class="hours-thursday">
				<h3>Thursday Night</h3>
				<p class="registration-time"><span class="bold">Registration time:</span> 6:30pm</p>
				<p class="start-time"><span class="bold">Start time:</span> 7:00pm</p>
				<p class="format">
					<span class="bold">Format:</span> One game a day with a long time control. The current time control is 40 moves in 90 minutes, then game in 30 minutes with a 30 second-increment from move 1.
				</p>
				<p class="entry-fee">
					<span class="bold">Entry fee:</span> $5. Additionally, CFC membership is required. If purchased together with club membership, the total of that is $68 a year for adults (less for juniors).
				</p>
				<p class="atmosphere">
					<span class="bold">Atmosphere:</span> Friendly, but serious. Noise levels are kept at a minimum and the games are serious.
				</p>
				<p class="players">
					<span class="bold">Type of players:</span> Everyone from strong Masters (even International Masters) to beginners. The tournament runs as an Accelerated Swiss, which means that, typically, lower rated players will not play against the top rated opponents, unless they do really well, thus it is often the case that the end of the tournament first lac is shared by players rated 2400 and 1400.

				<p class="registration-time"><span class="bold">Registration time:</span> 12:30pm</p>
